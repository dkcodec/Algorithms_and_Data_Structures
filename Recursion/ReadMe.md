Assignment 1: Recursion 
1. Write and test a recursive function that returns the sum of the squares of the
   first n positive integers.
   1^2 + 2^2 + … + 𝑛^2

   Sample Input: n = 4

   Sample Output: 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 30
2. Write and test a recursive function that returns the sum of the first n
   elements of an array.
3. Write a recursive method to compute the sum of the first n positive integers.
4. Write and test a recursive function that returns the sum of the first n powers
   of a base b.

   𝑏^0 + 𝑏^1 + 𝑏^2 + … + 𝑏^𝑛

   Sample Input: b = 4, n = 3

   Sample Output: 4^0 + 4^1 + 4^2 + 4^3 = 85
5. Given a positive integer N and a sequence of N elements. You have to
   display given sequence in reverse order.

   Note. The program is forbidden to declare arrays, and use the cycles (even
   for input).

   Sample Input:

    3

   1 2 3

   Sample Output: 

    3 2 1
6. Given a positive integer N and a sequence of N strings. You have to display
   given sequence in reverse order.

   Note. The program is forbidden to declare arrays (only one char array in
   function is allowed), and use the cycles (even for input).
   
    Input: First line contains n (1<=n<=100). The next n lines contain onedimension char arrays. Array is no longer that 20 symbols.

    Output: The sequence of element in reverse order.
   
    Sample Input:

   3

   Abc

   bcdh

   abcdef

   Sample Output:

   abcdef

   bcdh

   abc
7. Print the square that consists of NxN cells filled with numbers from 1 to

10. For the following task:
    - Any other libraries except very basic ones are NOT allowed.
    - Global and Static variables are not allowed.
    - You can’t add more parameters or call helper functions.
    
    Power of two. Given 1 parameter - an integer n, return true if it is a power of
    two. Otherwise, return false.

    An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n = 2^x

    Test the function properly in main and give the output as shown in Figure 1.
